1. Created a parent process that runs indefinitely using an infinite loop.
2. Registered separate signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT using the signal() function.
3. First child process sleeps for 5 seconds and sends SIGTERM to the parent.
4. Second child process sleeps for 10 seconds and sends SIGINT to the parent.
5. Parent handles SIGTERM without exiting and exits gracefully upon receiving SIGINT.
