1. Created multiple child processes using the fork() system call.
2. Each child process terminates after execution using exit().
3. The parent process uses the wait() system call to collect the termination status of each child.
4. The parent prints the PID of each child process it cleans up.
5. Using wait() prevents zombie processes by removing terminated children from the process table.
