Question 2 [6 Points]
You are given a log file containing entries in the format:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS LEVEL MESSAGE
Example:
2025-01-12 10:15:22 INFO System started
2025-01-12 10:16:01 ERROR Disk not found
2025-01-12 10:16:45 WARNING High memory usage
2025-01-12 10:17:10 ERROR Network timeout
Requirements:
1. The script must accept the log file name as a command-line argument.
2. Validate that the file exists and is readable.
3. Count and display:
  - Total number of log entries
  - Number of INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages
4. Display the most recent ERROR message.
5. Generate a report file named logsummary_<date>.txt.
6. Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages.
