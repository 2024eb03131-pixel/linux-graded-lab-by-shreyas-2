1. Created sync.sh to compare files between two directories without copying or modifying them.
2. Used loops to identify files present only in dirA and only in dirB.
3. Used the cmp command to compare contents of files with the same name in both directories.
4. Displayed files whose contents differ while ignoring identical files.
5. Ensured the script performs only comparison operations as required.
